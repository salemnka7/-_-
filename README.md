  <h1>Music Recommendation System</h1>

  <p>This project implements a music recommendation system similar to Spotify's recommendation system, powered by machine learning. The system predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe using a dataset with '1' indicating repeated plays within a month. It tracks user song histories and timestamps to generate personalized song recommendations.</p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Music recommendation systems are essential for providing users with personalized music suggestions tailored to their tastes and preferences. This project aims to replicate the functionality of Spotify's recommendation system, which utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user song histories and generate recommendations.</p>

  <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe.</li>
    <li>Generates personalized song recommendations based on user song histories and timestamps.</li>
    <li>Utilizes machine learning algorithms for recommendation prediction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
  <p>The dataset used in this project contains user song histories and timestamps, with '1' indicating repeated plays within a month. Due to privacy and licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can use similar datasets available from public repositories or music streaming platforms for experimentation.</p>

  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository:</li>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your_username/music-recommendation-system.git</code></pre>
    <li>Install the required dependencies:</li>
    <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare your dataset containing user song histories and timestamps.</li>
    <li>Train the machine learning model using the provided dataset.</li>
    <li>Use the trained model to predict a user's likelihood of repeated plays for a given song.</li>
    <li>Generate personalized song recommendations based on the predictions.</li>
  </ol>
