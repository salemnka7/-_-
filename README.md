Music Recommendation System
This project implements a music recommendation system similar to Spotify's recommendation system, powered by machine learning. The system predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe using a dataset with '1' indicating repeated plays within a month. It tracks user song histories and timestamps to generate personalized song recommendations.

Introduction
Music recommendation systems are essential for providing users with personalized music suggestions tailored to their tastes and preferences. This project aims to replicate the functionality of Spotify's recommendation system, which utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user song histories and generate recommendations.

Features
Predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe.
Generates personalized song recommendations based on user song histories and timestamps.
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for recommendation prediction.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains user song histories and timestamps, with '1' indicating repeated plays within a month. Due to privacy and licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can use similar datasets available from public repositories or music streaming platforms for experimentation.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/music-recommendation-system.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset containing user song histories and timestamps.
Train the machine learning model using the provided dataset.
Use the trained model to predict a user's likelihood of repeated plays for a given song.
Generate personalized song recommendations based on the predictions.
